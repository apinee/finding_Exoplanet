## Exoplanet Detection Using Machine Learning

- **Objective**: Leveraged machine learning techniques to improve exoplanet detection accuracy, enhancing model performance from **87% to 93%**.
  
- **Dataset**: Analyzed a dataset of **5,087 stars**, each with **3,197 flux values** recorded over time, which enabled the creation of light curves to detect potential orbiting exoplanets.

- **Tech Stack**:
  - **Libraries**: Utilized Pandas, Seaborn, Numpy, and Matplotlib for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis.
  - **Machine Learning Model**: Implemented **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** with a **99.02% validation accuracy** to identify the nearest stars, enabling reliable exoplanet detection.
 
  - After KNN and handling the data embalance
